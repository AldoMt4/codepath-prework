## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

**Favorite Apps + Favorite Features:**
- Instagram: Story filters, DMs, Save posts
- Spotify: Custom playlists, Offline downloads
- TikTok: Personalized "For You" feed, Video filters

**App Idea:**
I would like to create an app called "Daily Vibes," where users can select a daily mood and receive customized background colors, quotes, and playlists based on how they are feeling. It would change visuals daily to keep users motivated and feeling connected.

## Notes

The main challenge was making sure the storyboard was properly connected to the Swift file (ViewController.swift) and handling connection errors between UI elements and actions.
